     * It is MANDATORY to use the ISO-standard format for DT.<br/>

     * <p/>
     * Syntax:<br/>
     * "YYYY-MM-DD" year (4 digits), month (2 digits), day (2 digits)<br/>
     * Do not use other separators such as "/", " ", "," or ".".<br/>
     * Partial dates are allowed:<br/>
     * "YYYY" - game was played in YYYY<br/>
     * "YYYY-MM" - game was played in YYYY, month MM<br/>
     * For games that last more than one day: separate other dates<br/>
     * by a comma (no spaces!); following shortcuts may be used:<br/>
     * "MM-DD" - if preceded by YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, MM-DD, MM or DD<br/>
     * "MM" - if preceded by YYYY-MM or MM<br/>
     * "DD" - if preceded by YYYY-MM-DD, MM-DD or DD<br/>
     * Shortcuts acquire the last preceding YYYY and MM (if necessary).<br/>
     * Note: interpretation is done from left to right.<br/><br/>
     * <p/>
     * Examples:<br/>
     * 1996-05,06 = played in May,June 1996<br/>
     * 1996-05-06,07,08 = played on 6th,7th,8th May 1996<br/>

     * <p/>
     * Note: it's recommended to use shortcuts whenever possible,<br/>
